 This extension file is no longer needed - all snail functionality
 has been integrated directly into ForestScene.swift to avoid conflicts.
 
 The snail system is fully implemented in:
 - ForestScene.swift (main integration)
 - SnailNPC.swift (snail behavior)
 - TimeControlButton.swift (testing support)
