# üåü **Boba in the Woods - Complete Project Guide** 

> **For New Claude Sessions**: This project is a cozy Apple-native boba shop game built in Swift/SpriteKit. The player runs a small boba shop surrounded by looping woods, focusing on ritual, atmosphere, and discovery. **Current focus: Clean, minimalist interactions with context-aware tapping system.**

## üßã **Boba Creation Workflow**

### **Step-by-Step Drink Making:**
1. **Walk to Brewing Station**: Large brown rectangle at (-300, 200)
2. **Select Tea**: Tap left tea area to cycle through tea types (regular ‚Üí light ‚Üí no ice)
3. **Add Toppings**: Tap right areas to toggle tapioca and foam
4. **Add Lid**: Tap bottom lid area to complete the drink
5. **Pickup Drink**: When complete, drink shakes - tap anywhere on brewing station to pick up
6. **Auto-Reset**: Station automatically resets, new drink can be started immediately

### **Visual Feedback:**
- **Tea Types**: Different colored liquids (dark brown, light brown, amber)
- **Toppings**: Black tapioca pearls at bottom, cream foam on top
- **Completion**: Drink shakes when ready, indicating it's pickupable
- **Recipe-Accurate Drinks**: Carried bobas show actual tea color and toppings created
- **Carry State**: Completed drinks float above character and are non-rotatable

## üéØ **Project Vision & Core Concept**

### **Game Design Pillars:**
- **üè† Safe Shop Space**: Central hub where snail enemy never enters
- **üßã Tactile Boba Making**: Ritualistic, haptic brewing process
- **üå≤ Looping Woods**: Mysterious forest that cycles back to shop
- **üëª NPCs with Hidden Sides**: Characters change between day/night
- **üêå Inevitable Snail Enemy**: Slow but persistent, returns player to shop
- **üîÑ Cycles & Discovery**: Time and space repeat with subtle variations

### **Design Philosophy:**
- **No HUD/Menus**: All interactions embodied in world
- **No Inventories**: One item carried at a time
- **No Progression Stats**: Growth through player knowledge
- **Optional Everything**: Brewing, gathering, decorating at player's pace
- **Subtle Consequences**: Actions shift world, effects discovered through play

## üìÅ **Architecture & File Structure**

```
BobaAtDawn/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameScene.swift          // Main orchestrator, camera, context-aware gestures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Character.swift          // Player movement, pathfinding, carrying

## üîß **Key Swift Concepts Used**

### **Enums with Methods:**
```swift
enum ObjectType {
    case drink, furniture, station, completedDrink
}

enum RotationState: Int, CaseIterable {
    case north = 0, east = 90, south = 180, west = 270
    func next() -> RotationState { /* cycles through states */ }
}
```

### **Context-Aware Touch Handling:**
```swift
private func handleContextTap(at location: CGPoint, node: SKNode) {
    // Route taps based on what was touched
    if let rotatableObj = node as? RotatableObject {
        if rotatableObj.canBeCarried { character.pickupItem(rotatableObj) }
    } else if let brewingArea = node as? BrewingArea {
        brewingStation.handleInteraction(brewingArea.areaType, at: location)
    } else {
        character.moveTo(location, avoiding: tables) // Default: move
    }
}
```

### **Recipe-Accurate Drink Generation:**
```swift
private func createRecipeAccurateDrink(from state: DrinkState) -> RotatableObject {
    let teaColor = getTeaColor(state.teaType) // Different colors per tea
    let drink = RotatableObject(type: .completedDrink, color: teaColor, shape: "drink")
    
    // Add mini-layers for toppings
    if state.hasTapioca { addMiniTapioca(to: drink) }
    if state.hasFoam { addMiniFoam(to: drink) }
    return drink
}
```

## üéØ **How Systems Connect**

### **Context-Aware Interaction Flow:**
1. User taps anywhere ‚Üí `handleContextTap(at:node:)`
2. System identifies touched object ‚Üí Routes to appropriate handler
3. Object-specific action ‚Üí Pickup, brew, move, or drop
4. Immediate feedback ‚Üí Visual response and state change

### **Pathfinding Flow:**
1. User taps empty space ‚Üí `character.moveTo(targetPosition)`
2. System checks for pathfinding graph ‚Üí `moveWithPathfinding()`
3. Creates start/end nodes ‚Üí Connect to obstacle graph
4. Finds optimal path ‚Üí `graph.findPath(from:to:)`
5. Follows waypoints ‚Üí `followPath()` with smooth animation

### **Recipe-Accurate Boba Creation Flow:**
1. User taps brewing areas ‚Üí `brewingStation.handleInteraction()`
2. Station updates drink state ‚Üí Tea, toppings, lid assembly
3. Complete drink shows animation ‚Üí Shaking effect
4. User taps station ‚Üí `createRecipeAccurateDrink()` generates custom drink
5. Station resets ‚Üí Ready for next creation cycle

## üîç **Testing Checklist**

### **Context-Aware Interactions:**
- [ ] **Single Tap Movement**: Tap empty space moves character with pathfinding
- [ ] **Object Pickup**: Tap objects directly picks them up (no long press needed)
- [ ] **Brewing Interactions**: Tap brewing areas cycles tea, toggles toppings, adds lid
- [ ] **Completed Drink Pickup**: Tap shaking station picks up custom boba
- [ ] **No Selection Circles**: No visual UI elements appear during interactions

### **Object Types & Behaviors:**
- [ ] **Tables**: Brown squares with corner dots, tap to select, two-finger rotate
- [ ] **Small Furniture**: Colored objects (red/blue/orange), directly pickupable
- [ ] **Test Drinks**: Green triangle, pickupable and rotatable when carried
- [ ] **Recipe Bobas**: Show actual tea colors and toppings, non-rotatable
- [ ] **Brewing Station**: Large brown station, immovable, always functional

### **Recipe-Accurate Boba System:**
- [ ] **Tea Colors**: Regular (dark brown), Light (light brown), No Ice (amber)
- [ ] **Toppings Visible**: Black tapioca dots, cream foam layers
- [ ] **Lid & Straw**: Gray lid with white straw when complete
- [ ] **Custom Combinations**: Each recipe creates unique visual result
- [ ] **Carry Authenticity**: Carried drinks match brewing station preview

## üöÄ **Next Development Priorities**

### **Immediate (Core Game Loop):**
1. **NPC System**: Basic wandering characters with day/night states
2. **Woods Generation**: Simple looping forest sections
3. **Time Cycle**: Day/night transitions affecting world

### **Medium-term (World Building):**
1. **Snail Enemy**: Slow pursuit behavior, return-to-shop mechanic
2. **Ingredient System**: Gathering resources from woods
3. **Customer Orders**: NPCs requesting specific drinks

### **Long-term (Polish & Depth):**
1. **Sound Design**: Ambient forest sounds, brewing audio
2. **Particle Effects**: Steam, magical elements
3. **Narrative Elements**: Environmental storytelling

## üí° **Architecture Notes for Development**

### **Extension Points:**
- **New Object Types**: Add to `ObjectType` enum and update behavior methods
- **New Interactions**: Extend `handleContextTap()` with new touch logic
- **New Drink Ingredients**: Add to brewing station and recipe generation system

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Pathfinding graph rebuilds when objects move
- Camera updates every frame (consider optimization for many objects)
- Recipe generation creates child nodes dynamically

### **Consistent Patterns:**
- All interactions use single tap (immediate response)
- All objects inherit from RotatableObject for consistency
- Context-aware routing centralized in GameScene
- Visual feedback always accompanies state changes
- No UI elements - pure world-based interactions
