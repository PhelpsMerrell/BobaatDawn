# Input Service Architecture Refactor

## Problem Solved
The original architecture had **tight coupling** between scenes and gesture handling:
- Scenes needed to implement `@objc` selector methods manually
- Gesture recognizers were created with scene as target, causing crashes when methods didn't exist
- Violated separation of concerns - scenes shouldn't know about gesture implementation details

## New Clean Architecture

### 1. Delegate Pattern
```swift
// Scenes implement delegate protocol
class GameScene: SKScene, InputServiceDelegate {
    
    // Clean delegate methods - no @objc selectors needed
    func inputService(_ service: InputService, didReceivePinch gesture: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
        // Handle pinch with access to scene's camera state
    }
}
```

### 2. Service Encapsulation
```swift
// InputService handles ALL gesture setup internally
inputService.setupGestures(for: view, context: .gameScene, config: nil, delegate: self)

// No more manual gesture recognizer creation in scenes
// No more selector name mismatches
// No more crashes from missing methods
```

### 3. Benefits

**Separation of Concerns:**
- `InputService` handles gesture recognition internally
- Scenes only implement business logic in delegate methods
- No implementation details leak to consumers

**Type Safety:**
- Delegate protocol enforces method signatures at compile time
- No more runtime crashes from missing selectors
- Clear contract between service and scenes

**Maintainability:**
- Adding new gestures only requires updating the service
- Scenes automatically get new gesture support via delegate
- Easy to test and mock

**Flexibility:**
- Different scenes can handle gestures differently via delegate
- Service can provide default behaviors
- Easy to disable gestures per scene via configuration

## Migration Complete

âœ… **GameScene** - Now uses delegate pattern  
âœ… **ForestScene** - Now uses delegate pattern  
âœ… **StandardInputService** - Handles all gestures internally  
âœ… **Protocol** - Clean delegate interface  

## Usage Example

```swift
class MyScene: SKScene, InputServiceDelegate {
    
    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        // Simple setup - service handles everything
        inputService.setupGestures(for: view, context: .gameScene, delegate: self)
    }
    
    // Clean delegate methods
    func inputService(_ service: InputService, didReceivePinch gesture: UIPinchGestureRecognizer) {
        // Handle pinch - no selector magic needed
    }
}
```

**Result:** No more crashes, cleaner code, proper separation of concerns! ðŸŽ‰
