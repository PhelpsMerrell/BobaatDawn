# Boba Sprites - Replace These Placeholders

The following sprite files need to be replaced with your Procreate exports:

## Required Sprites (in Assets.xcassets/Boba.spriteatlas/):

1. **cup_empty.png** - Base empty boba cup
2. **drink_regular.png** - Regular tea (brown/amber color)
3. **drink_light.png** - Light tea (lighter brown/tan)
4. **drink_no_ice.png** - Tea without ice (different visual)
5. **topping_tapioca.png** - Black tapioca pearls layer
6. **foam_cheese.png** - Cheese foam layer (cream colored)
7. **lid_straw.png** - Final lid with straw

## Export Guidelines:
- Export each layer as separate PNG with transparent background
- Keep same canvas size and positioning for proper layering
- Recommended size: 100x100px or larger
- Name files exactly as listed above

## Implementation:
- Currently using colored rectangles as placeholders
- Game implements layered brewing system
- Each sprite shows/hides based on player brewing choices
- All layers stack on same anchor point for proper assembly

Replace the placeholder sprites in the respective .imageset folders to see your art in the game!
